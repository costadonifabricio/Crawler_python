        "<p>In all these cases, virtual environments can help you. They have their own\ninstallation directories and they don\u2019t share libraries with other virtual\nenvironments.</p>",
        "<p>Currently, there are two common tools for creating Python virtual environments:</p>",
        "<p><a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html\" title=\"(in Python v3.12)\"><span class=\"xref std std-doc\">venv</span></a> is available by default in Python 3.3 and later, and installs\n<a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../../key_projects/#pip\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">pip</span></a> into created virtual environments in Python 3.4 and later\n(Python versions prior to 3.12 also installed <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../../key_projects/#setuptools\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">Setuptools</span></a>).</p>",
        "<p><a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../../key_projects/#virtualenv\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">virtualenv</span></a> needs to be installed separately, but supports Python 2.7+\nand Python 3.3+, and <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../../key_projects/#pip\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">pip</span></a>, <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../../key_projects/#setuptools\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">Setuptools</span></a> and <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../../key_projects/#wheel\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">wheel</span></a> are\nalways installed into created virtual environments by default (regardless of\nPython version).</p>",
        "<p>The basic usage is like so:</p>",
        "<p>Using <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html\" title=\"(in Python v3.12)\"><span class=\"xref std std-doc\">venv</span></a>:</p>",
        "<p>Using <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../../key_projects/#virtualenv\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">virtualenv</span></a>:</p>",
        "<p>For more information, see the <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html\" title=\"(in Python v3.12)\"><span class=\"xref std std-doc\">venv</span></a> docs or\nthe <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/index.html\" title=\"(in virtualenv v0.1)\"><span class=\"xref std std-doc\">virtualenv</span></a> docs.</p>",
        "<p>The use of <strong class=\"command\">source</strong> under Unix shells ensures\nthat the virtual environment\u2019s variables are set within the current\nshell, and not in a subprocess (which then disappears, having no\nuseful effect).</p>",

        "<p>This command should output a lot of text and once completed should generate two\nfiles in the <code class=\"file docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">dist</span></code> directory:</p>",
        "<p>The <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">tar.gz</span></code> file is a <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../../glossary/#term-Source-Distribution-or-sdist\"><span class=\"xref std std-term\">source distribution</span></a>\nwhereas the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">.whl</span></code> file is a <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../../glossary/#term-Built-Distribution\"><span class=\"xref std std-term\">built distribution</span></a>.\nNewer <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../../key_projects/#pip\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">pip</span></a> versions preferentially install built distributions, but will\nfall back to source distributions if needed. You should always upload a source\ndistribution and provide built distributions for the platforms your project is\ncompatible with. In this case, our example package is compatible with Python on\nany platform so only one built distribution is needed.</p>",
        "<p>Finally, it\u2019s time to upload your package to the Python Package Index!</p>",
        "<p>The first thing you\u2019ll need to do is register an account on TestPyPI, which\nis a separate instance of the package index intended for testing and\nexperimentation. It\u2019s great for things like this tutorial where we don\u2019t\nnecessarily want to upload to the real index. To register an account, go to\n<a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://test.pypi.org/account/register/\">https://test.pypi.org/account/register/</a> and complete the steps on that page.\nYou will also need to verify your email address before you\u2019re able to upload\nany packages.  For more details, see <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../../guides/using-testpypi/\"><span class=\"doc\">Using TestPyPI</span></a>.</p>",
        "<p>To securely upload your project, you\u2019ll need a PyPI <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://test.pypi.org/help/#apitoken\">API token</a>. Create one at\n<a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://test.pypi.org/manage/account/#api-tokens\">https://test.pypi.org/manage/account/#api-tokens</a>, setting the \u201cScope\u201d to \u201cEntire\naccount\u201d. <strong>Don\u2019t close the page until you have copied and saved the token \u2014 you\nwon\u2019t see that token again.</strong></p>",
        "<p>Now that you are registered, you can use <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../../key_projects/#twine\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">twine</span></a> to upload the\ndistribution packages. You\u2019ll need to install Twine:</p>",
        "<p>Once installed, run Twine to upload all of the archives under <code class=\"file docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">dist</span></code>:</p>",
        "<p>You will be prompted for a username and password. For the username,\nuse <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">__token__</span></code>. For the password, use the token value, including\nthe <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">pypi-</span></code> prefix.</p>",
        "<p>After the command completes, you should see output similar to this:</p>",
        "<p>Once uploaded, your package should be viewable on TestPyPI; for example:\n<code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">https://test.pypi.org/project/example_package_YOUR_USERNAME_HERE</span></code>.</p>",
        "<p>You can use <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../../key_projects/#pip\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">pip</span></a> to install your package and verify that it works.\nCreate a <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../installing-packages/#creating-and-using-virtual-environments\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">virtual environment</span></a>\nand install your package from TestPyPI:</p>",
        "<p>Make sure to specify your username in the package name!</p>",
        "<p>pip should install the package from TestPyPI and the output should look\nsomething like this:</p>",
        "<p class=\"admonition-title\">Note</p>",
        "<p>This example uses <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">--index-url</span></code> flag to specify TestPyPI instead of\nlive PyPI. Additionally, it specifies <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">--no-deps</span></code>. Since TestPyPI doesn\u2019t\nhave the same packages as the live PyPI, it\u2019s possible that attempting to\ninstall dependencies may fail or install something unexpected. While our\nexample package doesn\u2019t have any dependencies, it\u2019s a good practice to avoid\ninstalling dependencies when using TestPyPI.</p>",
        "<p>You can test that it was installed correctly by importing the package.\nMake sure you\u2019re still in your virtual environment, then run Python:</p>",
        "<p>and import the package:</p>",
        "<p><strong>Congratulations, you\u2019ve packaged and distributed a Python project!</strong>\n\u2728 \ud83c\udf70 \u2728</p>",
        "<p>Keep in mind that this tutorial showed you how to upload your package to Test\nPyPI, which isn\u2019t a permanent storage. The Test system occasionally deletes\npackages and accounts. It is best to use TestPyPI for testing and experiments\nlike this tutorial.</p>",
        "<p>When you are ready to upload a real package to the Python Package Index you can\ndo much the same as you did in this tutorial, but with these important\ndifferences:</p>",
        "<p>Choose a memorable and unique name for your package. You don\u2019t have to append\nyour username as you did in the tutorial, but you can\u2019t use an existing name.</p>",
        "<p>Register an account on <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://pypi.org\">https://pypi.org</a> - note that these are two separate\nservers and the login details from the test server are not shared with the\nmain server.</p>",
        "<p>Use <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">twine</span> <span class=\"pre\">upload</span> <span class=\"pre\">dist/*</span></code> to upload your package and enter your credentials\nfor the account you registered on the real PyPI.  Now that you\u2019re uploading\nthe package in production, you don\u2019t need to specify <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">--repository</span></code>; the\npackage will upload to <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://pypi.org/\">https://pypi.org/</a> by default.</p>",
        "<p>Install your package from the real PyPI using <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">python3</span> <span class=\"pre\">-m</span> <span class=\"pre\">pip</span> <span class=\"pre\">install</span> <span class=\"pre\">[your-package]</span></code>.</p>",

Help ensure your customers have the best experience on your site with synthetic monitoring. You\u2019ll be the first to know if your site is unavailable or slow, or if a site interaction is broken. Comprehensive monitoring includes real user monitoring. How your visitors experience your site can differ depending on the browser, device, and platform they use. Identify improvements, compare year-over-year data, and inform marketing decisions with usage metrics like top visited pages, top platforms, top browsers, active sessions, and bounce rates.</p>",
        "<p>Pingdom helps you provide excellent service and third-party proof of meeting key service objectives and SLAs with sharable and customizable reporting. As a web hosting provider, you may have agreements about site performance with your clients. For example, websites will be up 99.9% of the time, or webpages will have less than 3 seconds of load time. Because of these agreements, you should always be the first to know if an incident has occurred. If a website hosted by your service is unavailable, slow, or not functioning as expected, you can make sure the right people are alerted immediately. With Pingdom real user monitoring, you can set performance levels for what\u2019s considered satisfactory, so you can help ensure a seamless site experience for your customers. Public status pages allow you to provide third-party proof of achieving SLAs and keeping your customers happy.</p>",

With uptime monitoring, you can avoid unnecessary downtime and be alerted as soon as your site isn\u2019t available. Page speed monitoring will help you make optimization decisions armed with the size and load time of every element. Real user monitoring helps you filter by geography, device, or browser when real users are experiencing a problem.

        "<p>Given that package names on the Index are sharing a single flat\nnamespace, a unique name is a finite resource.

After\nconsultation with the PSF\u2019s General Counsel, adoption of the policy will then\nbe subject to a formal vote within the working group.</p>",
        "<p>This formal approval process will be used for both initial adoption of the\npolicy, and for adoption of any future amendments.</p>",

There are many possible scenarios here,\na non-exclusive list describing some real-world examples is presented\nbelow.  None of the following qualify for package name ownership\ntransfer:</p>",
        "<p>Again, the list above is not exclusive.  The maintainers of the Package\nIndex recommend users to get in touch with each other and solve the\nissue by respectful communication (see the PSF Code of Conduct <a class=\"footnote-reference brackets\" href=\"#id14\" id=\"id6\">[6]</a>).</p>",
        "<p>A project published on the Package Index meeting ANY of the following\nis considered invalid and will be removed from the Index:</p>",

        "<p>A project published on the Package Index meeting ANY of the following\nmay be considered infringing and subject to removal from the Index\nor transferral to a new owner:</p>",
        "<p>In the event of a complaint for intellectual property infringement,\na copy of the complaint will be sent to the package owner. In some\ncases, action may be taken by the Package Index maintainers before\nthe owner responds.</p>",
        "<p>The Python Software Foundation <a class=\"footnote-reference brackets\" href=\"#id15\" id=\"id7\">[7]</a> is the non-profit legal entity that\nprovides the Package Index as a community service.</p>",
        "<p>The Package Index maintainers can escalate issues covered by this\ndocument for resolution by the Packaging Workgroup if the matter is not clear\nenough.  Some decisions <em>require</em> additional judgement by the Board,\nespecially in cases of Code of Conduct violations or legal claims.\nRecommendations made by the Board are sent to the Packaging Workgroup <a class=\"footnote-reference brackets\" href=\"#id16\" id=\"id8\">[8]</a> for review.</p>",
        "<p>The Packaging Workgroup has the final say in any disputes covered by this document and\ncan decide to reassign or remove a project from the Package Index after\ncareful consideration even when not all requirements listed\nhere are met.</p>",
        "<p>If you want to take over an existing project name on PyPI,\nthese are the steps to follow:</p>",

        "<p>CPAN lets any user upload modules with the same name.  PAUSE, a related\nindex, only lists modules uploaded by the primary maintainer or listed\nco-maintainers.  CPAN documentation doesn\u2019t address disputes otherwise.</p>",
        "<p>GitHub\u2019s terms of service contain an exhaustive list of behavior\nnot meeting general conditions of use.  While not codified anywhere,\nGitHub does agree for users to reclaim abandoned account names by\narchiving the abandoned account and letting the other user or\norganization rename their account.  This is done on a case-by-case\nbasis.</p>",
        "<p>The original approach was to hope for the best and solve issues as they\narise without written policy.  This is not sustainable.  The lack of\ngenerally available guidelines in writing on package name conflict\nresolution is causing unnecessary tensions.  From the perspective of\nusers, decisions made by the Package Index maintainers without written\nguidelines may appear arbitrary.  From the perspective of the Package\nIndex maintainers, solving name conflicts is a stressful task due to\nrisk of unintentional harm due to lack of defined policy.</p>",
